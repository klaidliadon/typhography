Typography is a Rainmeter skin that uses Windows default font, **Segoe UI**, to obtain a clean look for your desktop.

## Bar
`Bar` is a transparent background that casts a black shadow on the left and the right of the desktop. It's recommended to enable the *click through* option and set its *position* to *on desktop*.

## Apps
`Apps` is a replacement for the main desktop icons: *computer*, *network*, *user folder*, *control panel*, and *recycle bin*. Its position is the top left corner.

## Clock
`Clock` is a simple clock with date and time. Clicking on launches the default calendar application. Its position is the top right corner.

## System
`System` contains various information about the System. It requires [Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) to be running to show the CPU temperature. The weather location is obtained from the current WAN IP. Its position is the bottom right corner.
